This is a malicious program that executes a reverse shell from target machine.
It is to be used for educational purposes only, I am not responsible for any damage.

When I was reserching how internet functions on lower levels of abstraction and started watching "Mr. Robot" on Netflix I quickly got motivated to learn 
about hacking and security. When I came across SSH and learned how it functions it occured to me that it can be used to control machines remotely without
owners permission. I made this malware that opens an SSH session from remote machine if a user opens a malicious file. This project helped me understand the 
importance of keeping ports closed and secured and I think it can help others too so feel free to study it.
